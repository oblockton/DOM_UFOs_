#  JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a (js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 

## Task

###  Automatic Table and Date Search

* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Assign columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Multiple Search Categories

*

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
